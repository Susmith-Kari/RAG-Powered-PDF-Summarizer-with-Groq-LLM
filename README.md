##📚 RAG-Based Text Summarizer
###🚀 Overview
The RAG-Based Text Summarizer is an advanced AI-powered system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to generate concise and meaningful summaries of long documents. It enhances traditional summarization techniques by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models, ensuring more accurate and context-aware summaries.

###🎯 Features
✅ Multi-Strategy Summarization: Implements Map-Reduce, Refine, and optimized Hybrid approaches. ✅ Context-Aware Summaries: Uses retrieved knowledge to generate more informed responses. ✅ Efficient Text Processing: Handles large documents efficiently with text chunking. ✅ Scalable and Customizable: Can be adapted for various use cases like research papers, news articles, and legal documents.

###🏗️ How It Works
Text Preprocessing: Splits large documents into manageable chunks.

Vectorization: Converts text into embeddings using Hugging Face models.

Retrieval: Uses FAISS to fetch relevant context from a knowledge base.

Summarization: Applies RAG-based models to generate accurate summaries.

###🎙️ Usage
from summarizer import RAGSummarizer

Initialize summarizer
summarizer = RAGSummarizer()

Provide input text
document = """Long text that needs to be summarized...""" summary = summarizer.summarize(document) print(summary)

###📊 Results & Performance
Higher Accuracy than traditional extractive summarization methods.

Improved Context Retention due to retrieval-augmented approach.

Scalable for large documents and multi-page reports.

###🛠️ Future Enhancements
🔹 Integrate Multilingual Support 🌍 🔹 Enhance Summarization Speed ⚡ 🔹 Add Custom Model Fine-Tuning 🎯
